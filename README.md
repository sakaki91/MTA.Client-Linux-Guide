# MTA.Client-Linux-Guide
__*Unofficial*__ MTA Linux-Guide!  
This project is unofficial and has no affiliation with __[Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/)__, much less with the __[Multi Theft Auto](https://multitheftauto.com/)__ project.  

I honestly found the "Official" [MTA Client documentation](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Client_on_Linux_Manual) for Linux somewhat confusing and not very user-friendly for new users, so I decided to "create my own" unofficial version, based on my own knowledge and "diluted" parts of the official guide, furthermore, many things will be done in a more automated way to save time and effort for those who need to install them!  

### __This project is ACTIVE! and will be updated soon!__
